MY MODEL USES TENSORFLOW 2.5.0

JUST RUN ALL THE CELLS FOR EXECUTION

NOTE:- DUE TO LARGE RUNTIME AND SLOW INTERNET CONNECTION I WAS NOT ABLE TO RUN THE COMPLETE PROGRAM. SO IT WAS EXECUTED INCOMPLETELY AT THE TIME OF SUBMISSION. I APOLOGIZE FOR THIS AND I WILL TRY TO COMPLETE THE CODE NEXT TIME WELL BEFORE SUBMISSION.
